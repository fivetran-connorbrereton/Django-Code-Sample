## Getting Started

### Environment

* Make sure you have virtualenv installed (`pip install virtualenv`)
* Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

### Python Stuff
* Make sure you're using Python 3Â `python --version`Â orÂ `python3 --version`

Then, navigate to the server in your browser at localhost:8000 ðŸ˜Š

All files will automatically reload when they're changed via browsersync. If you want to adjust the base styling, it's in `vandelay_project/theme/templates`.
